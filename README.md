# AES Implementation
Bradley Taylor

### Compiling and Running
Running this implementation is really quite simple. It will however require gcc compiler to be already installed on your machine. The commands for running it are:
```
cd src
make
make run
```

### Rescources Used
In order to implement this project the only AES rescources that I used were the ones provided in the project spec.

### Test Cases
I am happy to say that my code passes all of the tests listed on the website. You are welcome to run or examine my unit tests found in the test directory. The commands for running the unit tests are:
```
cd test
make test
```
